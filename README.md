# Cell-Migration
3D Cell migration codes

Single factor simulations

Cell_Migraiton_AI - Linearly varies fiber alignment from 0-0.8

Cell_Migration_BD - Linearly varies binding site density from 5-7

Cell_Migration_dT - Simulates migration at increasing time steps

Multi factor simulations

Cell_Migration_CL1 - Radomly assignes values for fiber density, fiber alignment, and fiber diameter 

Cell_Migration_FD_FP - Linearly varies fiber diamter from 0.15 to 0.25 um, and fiber density from 0.5*10^-3 to 2*10^-3 fibers/um^3

Cell_Migration_ST2 - Linearly varies pseudopod extension frequency from 0.06 to 0.5 s^-1, with binding site density set to 5.2, 6, and 8

Cell_Migration_RT2 - Linearly varies simulation time from 12 to 60 hours. Binding set density set to values so average cell speed is 5, 9, 45 um/h
